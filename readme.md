# Electron-PA
A personal assistant desktop application using Electron.

The aim is to create a 'personal assistant' that can:
- Schedule tasks onto a calendar (Full CRUD)
- Journals and notes (Full CRUD)
- Display the days weather
- more to come...

## Why Electron
Electron is an open-source framework, originally developed by GitHub for developing a cross-platform text editor that works with web technologies. The Electron framework allows the development of desktop applications using HTML, CSS & JS which ultimately makes the application platform agnostic. Another powerful benefit of Electron is the ability to perform native OS interactions, allowing the functionality of traditional desktop applications to coincide with the functionality of web development.
